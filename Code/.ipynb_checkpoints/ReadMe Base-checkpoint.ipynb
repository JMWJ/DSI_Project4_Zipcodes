    "# Project 4 - The Client Project \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The ***objective*** of the client project is to ***use zipcodes to proxy home values and loss in event of disaster***. Our project consists of building a tool to return housing and population metrics in a given zipcode.  The user will feed the code with a comma delimited list of affected areas (zip codes, can be int or str format) as input, and retrieve the current property values.  \n",

    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interesting Packages Used\n",
    "---\n",
    "For our project we mainly leveraged [folium](https://pypi.org/project/folium/) and [uszipcode](https://pypi.org/project/uszipcode/) packages in Python to create the tool and to pull the additional demographic information based on zipcode.  Folium creates a rendering of a map based on lat/long values and then given a zipcode it will return a circle that you can hover over with a mouse to display demographic information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Information\n",
    "---\n",
    "For the home value data, we used the [Zillow Research](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/) page to download flat files of ***Median Home Values by Top and Bottom Tiers***.  The tier system in Zillow is divided into thirds given a ***geography*** parameter that allowed for us to pull data on the zipcode level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the Python package [uszipcode](https://pypi.org/project/uszipcode/) mentioned above has datasets within the package that returned high level metrics give a zip.  We used that data to create a dataframe that gets passed into the our display tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations of Data\n",
    "Due to usage of Zillow Research data and the specificity of top and bottom tier informatino given a zipcode.  The number of zipcodes available to use that had populated values across top, bottom, overall tables were approximately 5k, 2.8k, and 10k respectively.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Informtation on the zipcode level is not populated as well due to Zillow's limited number of fully populated zipcodes.  This is because Zillow will only have information for zips that list their housing values.  It is not a complete set of all homes within a given geographic location.\n",

    "1. ***Code*** Folder, N Files, Organized with _NB suffix\n",
    "  * NB1 - NB3 contains code to clean Zillow dataset: mostly dropping NULLS and columns.\n",
    "  * NB4 is the function that creates a base demographic dataset using the Zillow zipcodes.\n",
    "  * NB5 is the folium function that renders a map and circles that will display the demographic info based on zips that feed into it. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",

    "2. ***Data*** Folder, N files\n",
    "  * All files with ***cleaned_*** suffix are datasets that contain cleaned Zillow data for merging in NB4 above\n",
    "  * final_flat_for_folium.csv is the flat file passed into the folium function that has the Zillow data. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "3. ***Raw_data_files*** Folder, N files containing raw files used to generate cleaned data files in Data & Code folders above\n",

    "4. ***zipcode*** Folder, N files containing zipcode database created in SQLite for intial usage and other files that support the final Code folder.  \n",

    "1. Find a data source that has complete housing information base on zipcodes\n",
    "2. Create disaster function <- given severity of disaster, use median home values scaled by "
